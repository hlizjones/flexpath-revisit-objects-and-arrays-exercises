Exercise 1: Advanced Object Creation and Property Manipulation

Problem:

Create an object `person` with properties 'firstName' and 'lastName'. 

Then, without modifying the original object, add a method 'getFullName' that 
returns the full name of the person. 

Ensure that 'getFullName' is non-enumerable, and cannot be modified or deleted.
