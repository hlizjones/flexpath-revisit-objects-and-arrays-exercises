Exercise 2: Prototypal Inheritance with Object.create


Problem:

Create a prototype object `animal` with a method 'speak' that 
returns the string 'Generic animal sound'. 

Then, create an object `dog` that uses `animal` as its prototype. 

Add a 'speak' method to `dog` that returns the string 'Woof!'. 

Demonstrate how `dog` inherits from `animal` and how method overriding works.
